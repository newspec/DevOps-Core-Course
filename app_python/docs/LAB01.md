# 1. Framework selection.
## Choice
I have chose FastAPI because I have had an experience with it and have no experience with other frameworks.

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Criteria | FastAPI (chosen) | Flask | Django (DRF) |
|---------|-----------------|-------|--------------|
| Primary use | APIs / microservices | Lightweight web apps & APIs | Full-stack apps & large APIs |
| Performance model | ASGI (async-ready) | WSGI (sync by default) | WSGI/ASGI (heavier stack) |
| Built-in API docs | Yes (Swagger/OpenAPI) | No (manual/add-ons) | Yes (via DRF) |
| Validation / typing | Strong (type hints + Pydantic) | Manual or extensions | Strong (serializers) |
| Boilerplate | Low | Very low | Higher |
| Learning curve | Low–medium | Low | Medium–high |
| Best fit for this lab | Excellent | Good | Overkill |

# 2. Best Practices Applied
## Clean Code Organization

### 1) Clear Function Names
The code uses descriptive, intention-revealing function names that clearly communicate what each block returns:

```python
def get_service_info():
    """Get information about service."""
    ...

def get_system_info():
    """Get information about system."""
    ...

def get_runtime_info():
    """Get information about runtime."""
    ...

def get_request_info(request: Request):
    """Get information about request."""
    ...
```
**Why it matters**: Clear naming improves readability, reduces the need for extra comments, and makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

### 2) Proper imports grouping
Imports are organized by category (standard library first, then third-party libraries), which is the common Python convention:
```python
import logging
import os
import platform
import socket
from datetime import datetime, timezone

import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, status
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException
```
**Why it matters**: Grouped imports make dependencies easier to understand at a glance, help keep the file structured, and align with typical linting rules.

### 3) Comments only where needed
Instead of excessive inline comments, the code relies on clear names and short docstrings:
```python
"""
DevOps Info Service
Main application module
"""

def get_uptime():
    """Get uptime."""
    ...
```
**Why it matters**: Too many comments can become outdated. Minimal documentation plus clean naming keeps the codebase readable and accurate.

### 4) Follow PEP 8
The implementation follows common PEP 8 practices:
- consistent indentation and spacing,
- snake_case for variables and function names,
- configuration/constants placed near the top of the module (HOST, PORT, DEBUG),
- readable multi-line formatting for long calls:
```python
"""
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
)
```
**Why it matters**: PEP 8 improves consistency, supports teamwork, and makes the code compatible with linters/formatters such as `flake8`, `ruff`, and `black`.

## Error Handling
The service implements centralized error handling using FastAPI/Starlette exception handlers. This ensures that errors are returned in a consistent JSON format and that clients receive meaningful messages instead of raw stack traces.

### HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Not Found)
A dedicated handler processes HTTP-related exceptions and customizes the response for missing endpoints.

```python
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException

@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
async def http_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    if exc.status_code == 404:
        return JSONResponse(
            status_code=404,
            content={
                "error": "Not Found",
                "message": "Endpoint does not exist",
            },
        )

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=exc.status_code,
        content={
            "error": "HTTP Error",
            "message": exc.detail if exc.detail else "Request failed",
        },
    )
```
**Why it matters**:
- Provides a clear and user-friendly message for invalid routes.
- Keeps error responses consistent across the API.
- Avoids exposing internal implementation details to the client.

### Unhandled exceptions (500 Internal Server Error)
A global handler catches any unexpected exceptions and returns a safe, standardized response.

```python
@app.exception_handler(Exception)
async def unhandled_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: Exception):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=500,
        content={
            "error": "Internal Server Error",
            "message": "An unexpected error occurred",
        },
    )
```
**Why it matters**:
- Prevents server crashes from unhandled errors.
- Ensures clients always receive valid JSON (important for automation/scripts).
- Helps keep production behavior predictable while preserving the option to log the exception internally.

## 3. Logging
The service includes basic logging configuration to improve observability and simplify debugging. Logs are useful both during development (troubleshooting requests and behavior) and in production (monitoring, incident investigation).

### Logging setup
A global logging configuration is defined at startup with a consistent log format:
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
**Why it matters**:
- Provides timestamps and log levels for easier troubleshooting.
- A consistent format makes logs easier to parse in log aggregators (e.g., ELK, Loki).
- Centralized config avoids inconsistent logging across modules.

### Startup logging
The application logs an informational message when it starts:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    logger.info("Application starting...")
    uvicorn.run("app:app", host=HOST, port=PORT, reload=True)
```
**Why it matters**:
- Confirms that the service started successfully.
- Helps identify restarts and uptime issues.

### Request logging (debug level)
Each endpoint logs basic request information (method and path):
```python
@app.get("/", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
async def root(request: Request):
    logger.debug(f"Request: {request.method} {request.url.path}")
    ...
```
**Why it matters**:
- Helps trace API usage during development.
- Useful for debugging routing problems and unexpected client behavior.

## 4. Dependencies (requirements.txt)
The project keeps dependencies minimal and focused on what is required to run a FastAPI service in production.
### requirements.txt
```txt
fastapi==0.122.0
uvicorn[standard]==0.38.0
```
**Why it matters**:
- Faster builds & simpler setup: fewer packages mean faster installation and fewer moving parts.
- Lower risk of conflicts: minimal dependencies reduce version incompatibilities and “dependency hell”.
- Better security posture: fewer third-party libraries reduce the overall attack surface.
- More predictable deployments: only installing what the service truly needs improves reproducibility across environments (local, CI, Docker, VM).

## 5. Git Ignore (.gitignore)

A `.gitignore` file is used to prevent committing temporary, machine-specific, or sensitive files into the repository.

### Recommended `.gitignore`
```gitignore
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
venv/
*.log

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# OS
.DS_Store
```
**Why it matters**:
- Keeps the repository clean: avoids committing generated files (`__pycache__`, build outputs, logs).
- Improves portability: prevents OS- and IDE-specific files from polluting the project and causing noisy diffs.
- Protects secrets: ensures configuration files like `.env` (which may contain API keys or credentials) are not accidentally pushed.
- Reduces merge conflicts: fewer irrelevant files tracked by Git means fewer conflicts between contributors.

# 3. API Documentation
The service exposes two endpoints: the main information endpoint and a health check endpoint.
## Request/response examples
